A project that emulates an interactive text adventure powered by a Pushdown Automata (PDA) for command validation, coupled with a Custom List Automata. Navigate grammar rules, validate room transitions, and manage inventory with precision. A technical fusion of formal language theory and gameplay mechanics.
